### Optimizing Disease Diagnosis on Amazon Web Services

This research aims to address the challenge of feature redundancy in large medical datasets and enhance the performance of conventional deep learning models through the use of ensemble learning techniques on a cloud platform. The project utilizes big data, genetic algorithms for feature selection, model improvement, and deep learning training. The improved model, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensures scalability, availability, and accessibility.

### Relational Database Driven Road Safety Web Application for Texas Drivers

Drive Smart Texas is a web application designed to bolster road safety in Texas, granting users access to historical accident data tailored to their specific route and conditions. We successfully cleaned and processed a large traffic incident dataset, stored the data in MySQL Workbench, and migrated the database to ClearDB for seamless Heroku deployment. The result is a user-friendly platform that uses database queries to not only offers insights into potential route hazards but also provides an avenue for reporting new incidents.
