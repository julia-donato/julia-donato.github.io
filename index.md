### Optimizing Disease Diagnosis on Amazon Web Services

This research aims to address the challenge of feature redundancy in large medical datasets and enhance the performance of conventional deep learning models through the use of ensemble learning techniques on a cloud platform. The project utilizes big data, genetic algorithms for feature selection, model improvement, and deep learning training. The improved model, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensures scalability, availability, and accessibility.

### Data-Driven Road Safety Web Application for Texas Drivers

Drive Smart Texas is a web application designed to bolster road safety in Texas, granting users access to historical accident data tailored to their specific route and conditions. We successfully cleaned and processed a large traffic incident dataset, stored in MySQL Workbench, and navigated challenges such as migrating the database to ClearDB for seamless Heroku deployment. The result is a user-friendly platform that not only offers insights into potential route hazards but also provides an avenue for reporting new incidents.
